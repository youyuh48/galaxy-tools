# centrifuge_indices.loc.sample
# This is a *.loc.sample file distributed with Galaxy that enables tools
# to use a directory of indexed data files. This one is for GOTTCHA.
# See the wiki: http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/NGS%20Local%20Setup
# First create these data files and save them in your own data directory structure.
# Then, create a bowtie_indices.loc file to use those indexes with tools.
# Copy this file, save it with the same name (minus the .sample),
# follow the format examples, and store the result in this directory.
# The file should include an one line entry for each index set.
# The path points to the "basename" for the set, not a specific file.
# It has three text columns seperated by TABS.
#
# <unique_id>	<display_name>	<file_base_path>
